// This file is for VERBS (commands) and supporting code ONLY.

// DO NOT PUT FUNCTIONS HERE. Functions belong in:
//   Resources/functions/classes/Player.cs
//
// The system automatically combines verbs from this file with functions
// from Resources/functions/classes/Player.cs by class name. Both files
// represent the same logical class, but are separated by file system
// location for organizational purposes.
//
// WARNING: Do NOT duplicate code between this file and the functions file.
// If you need helper methods that are used by both verbs and functions,
// they should go in the functions file (since functions can call them,
// and verbs can call functions).

    // public verb Say(string message) { ... }
    // public verb Emote(string action) { ... }
